# Hello, world :)

Next up:

* speed up saving
	* check password, enqueue update, send response. Doing the update synchronously is too slow :(.
* creating new pages
* uploading/including images
* adding commit messages
* creating accounts

Done:

* draw a nice picture explaining the rough serverless-wiki concept
* refresh when logging out
* allow editing the index page
* show a gray layover while saving
* 10 bcrypt iterations rather than 12
* POSTing it to the lambda
* editing the markdown from the browser 
* push html to storage
* check out, update and push markdown
* check credentials
* gh-pages invalidates its cache too rarely.. moved to s3
