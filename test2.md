# Hello, world :)

Next up:

* allow editing the index page
* show a 'spinner' while saving
* refresh when logging out
* speed up saving
	* check password, enqueue update, send response. Really doing the update is too slow :(.
* draw a nice picture explaining the rough serverless-wiki concept
* creating new pages

Done:

* 10 bcrypt iterations rather than 12
* POSTing it to the lambda
* editing the markdown from the browser 
* push html to storage
* check out, update and push markdown
* check credentials
* gh-pages invalidates its cache too rarely.. moved to s3
